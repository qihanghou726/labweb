journal = {Measurement Science and Technology},
abstract = {Millimeter-wave radar is widely used in family safety, rehabilitation, and assisted living due to its ability to operate in all weathers and all day. To address the problem whereby the radar detection angle significantly impacts human behavior recognition, a recognition method based on multi-angle radar observation is adopted. We proposed a novel radar selection method called the energy domain ratio method to choose a radar with more sensitive features. Then, local tangent space alignment and an adaptive extreme learning machine (ELM) are presented to enhance the recognition rate of the model in a high-noise environment. A multi-angle entropy feature and an improved ELM are developed to identify human micro-motion in a low-noise indoor environment. The effect of observation distance on the recognition effect was also explored. The experimental results show that the proposed model has a more than 86% recognition rate for human behavior in outdoor scenes and a recognition accuracy of more than 98% for indoor micro-action.},
