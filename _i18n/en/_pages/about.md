I am a PhD student in the Department of [Electronic and Computer Engineering](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/) at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/), under the guidance of [Professor Fumin Zhang](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/eefumin). My research focuses on robotics and decision-making AI. I am particularly interested in developing intelligent systems that can perceive and reason about their environment to make autonomous decisions.

Prior to my PhD, I earned a [Master of Science in Computer Science](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/master-science-computer-science) from the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) in 2023.  During my master's program, I specialized in machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, with a particular focus on reinforcement learning, PPO, and diffusion models. My research projects were primarily centered on the intersection of artificial intelligence algorithms and signal processing. I worked with [Dr. Zhaolin Zhang](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6150-5326) to apply machine learning methods to signal processing for human motion recognition using millimeter-wave radar.

I also have experience working on robot perception and unmanned driving. Since graduating from [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/) with a bachelor's degree, I have worked as a robotics engineer in [Professor Yinan Zhao](https://comm.hdu.edu.cn/_s70/2023/0216/c2866a241809/page.psp)'s team. We are dedicated to creating a high-precision robot perception system that works around the clock. We have developed a complete set of radar-based autonomous mapping and navigation systems that do not rely on visual sensors, and have produced multiple prototypes.
